This algorithm discusses the relay node placement problem in wireless sensor networks, where the objective is to optimize the number of relay nodes in a network, which results in connected network (between relay and sensor nodes). In this study, the main factor is the cost which limits the placement of relay nodes. The cost is constrained by euclidean distance, range and the budget. The maximal network is one which has a high level of connectedness for a disconnected graph. The goal is to find a network of sensor and relay nodes that has a high level of connectedness given a cost constraint. This is measured by two metrics, the first being the number of connected components and the second being with the size of the largest connected component. 

The Paper was implemented as a part of "Foundation of Algorithm final project" in Spring 2019.
